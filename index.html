			<h3>Education</h3>

		<p>After completing my first year at the University of Oregon, I transferred into The New School's Eugene Lang Liberal Arts College. As a sophomore standing, I am still exploring options for my major, but am considering pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Economics. Currently, my coursework focuses greatly on the honing the skills needed to cultivate and demonstrate effective research through writing and data visualization. My current coursework includes:</p>

		<h3>Personal Life</h3>

			<p>Growing up in the metropolitan city of Seattle, I acquired a taste for cobble-stone streets, the sound of car horns and the smell of freshly ground espresso beans. Growing up in the temperate Pacific Northwest, I acquired a taste for muddy shoes, long hikes and the sound of rain against my window. These are the most vivid memories I have from childhood, and the ones I am the fondest of. But like all small-yet-detailed memories, they were often outshined by the bigger, aspiration-driven ones.</p>

			<p>In elementary school, I swore I would be a ballerina when I grew up. Most afternoons consisted of a 35-minute drive through the center of downtown to ballet class; I would throw on my pink leotard and ballet slippers and let my dance instructor twist my hair into a perfect cinnamon-bun. Bobby pins and hairspray clung to my hair, but it didn’t bother me one bit.</p>

			<p>In middle school, I swore I would be a neurosurgeon when I grew up. I thought hard about the future that I wanted to invent for myself and tried desperately to prove it. One morning in June at the end of my eight-grade year, my biology instructor brought us fetal pigs to dissect. Some kids grew queasy from the smell alone; other kids, like me, wasted no time before diving into the digestive, reproductive and urinary tracts. I remember that day clearly. My teacher looked down at me with warm eyes and said: “kid, I think you may have just found your passion.” All I could do was smile.</p>

			<p>In high school, I had no idea who I wanted to be when I grew up. At the time, I was most concerned with the “growing-up” itself and trusted that all other things would follow. I watched many of my peers around me struggle to find out who and what they wanted to be; we were all in the same boat, trying to find our own ways to express ourselves in the real world. That’s when I turned to language. In particular, the French language. Like most other students, I started taking a language to fulfill a graduation requirement. After my first three years studying in high school, I realized it was much, much more.</p>
			<p>My final year in high school, my father and I opened our Seattle home to three foreign exchange students. The first time-United-States-goers came from Belgium and Germany and were all native-born French speakers. Over a ten-month period, the girls and I took turns exchanging laughs, memories, long car rides and cook-offs, preparing our favorite childhood meals. As if the homemade steak tar-tar and pommes frites weren’t enough, my time with my exchange students taught me the importance of language, and all that it can bring into a single household.</p>
